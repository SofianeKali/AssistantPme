## Overview
IzyInbox is an intelligent web application designed to automate administrative tasks for SMEs. It leverages AI for email analysis and automates the management of quotes, invoices, appointments, and documents.

The project aims to become a leading solution for smart automation for busy managers, with ambitions for broad market adoption.

## User Preferences
I prefer detailed explanations.
I want to be asked before major changes are made to the codebase.
I like an iterative development approach.
I want the agent to prioritize robust error handling and logging.
I prefer to see a clear plan before implementation.

## System Architecture
The application uses a modern web stack:
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI provide a responsive and aesthetically pleasing user interface. The design system incorporates a professional blue color scheme, Inter typography for UI, and JetBrains Mono for code/data, supporting both dark and light modes. Visual icon and color pickers enhance UX for category management. Sidebar menus include real-time count badges.
- **Backend**: Express.js with Node.js provides a robust API layer for business logic and data handling.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, hosted on Neon, for persistent storage of all application data.
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI's GPT-5 is central to intelligent email analysis, response generation, and appointment suggestions, including natural language rule creation for custom alerts.
- **Authentication**: A dual authentication system supports Replit Auth (OpenID Connect) for administrators and direct Replit users, and Email/Password for invited users.
- **Document Storage**: Google Drive is integrated for secure and organized storage of extracted documents, with automatic categorization into a hierarchical folder structure.
- **UI/UX Decisions**: Consistent display of category icons and colors across the application (Dashboard, Settings, Email Badges). Dynamic displays for task statuses in the dashboard.
- **System Design Choices**: Global category system with flexible assignment to multiple email accounts via a junction table. Category deletion automatically transfers affected emails to a fallback "autre" category. Email read/unread status is tracked independently of processed status. Tasks associated with an email are automatically completed when the email is marked as "trait√©". Task assignment to users is supported. Appointment selection dialog for days with multiple appointments. Automated scanning of individual email accounts.

**Key Features**:
- **Dashboard**: High-level overview of critical alerts, monthly statistics, activity summaries, and "Tasks in Progress" card with quick status changes.
- **Email Management**: AI-powered categorization, priority/sentiment detection, auto-response generation, task assignment, and alerts. Supports bulk processing and individual email account scanning. Features read/unread status tracking and category-based automatic marking as processed.
- **Calendar**: Monthly visualization and automated scheduling of appointments from emails, with AI-driven preparation.
- **Document Management**: Automatic extraction, classification, and storage of email attachments on Google Drive with full-text search.
- **Alert System**: Configurable custom alerts using natural language prompts interpreted by GPT-5.
- **Configuration**: Manages email account integration (IMAP/SMTP), intelligent tag creation, AI feature toggles, and automation settings, including comprehensive category management (create, read, update, delete) with visual pickers.
- **User Management**: Role-based access control and task assignment.
- **Advanced Features**: Sentiment analysis, KPIs, and automated reminders.
