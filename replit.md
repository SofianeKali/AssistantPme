# IzyInbox - Assistant Administratif Intelligent pour PME

## Overview
IzyInbox is an intelligent web application designed to automate administrative tasks for SMEs. It leverages AI for email analysis and automates the management of quotes, invoices, appointments, and documents. The core purpose is to streamline administrative workflows, enhance efficiency, and provide actionable insights for small and medium-sized businesses. The project aims to become a leading solution for smart automation for busy managers, with ambitions for broad market adoption.

## User Preferences
I prefer detailed explanations.
I want to be asked before major changes are made to the codebase.
I like an iterative development approach.
I want the agent to prioritize robust error handling and logging.
I prefer to see a clear plan before implementation.

## System Architecture
The application uses a modern web stack:
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI provide a responsive and aesthetically pleasing user interface. The design system incorporates a professional blue color scheme, Inter typography for UI, and JetBrains Mono for code/data, supporting both dark and light modes. Visual icon and color pickers enhance UX for category management. Sidebar menus include real-time count badges.
- **Backend**: Express.js with Node.js provides a robust API layer for business logic and data handling. Password encryption for email accounts uses AES-256-GCM with automatic migration of plaintext passwords.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, hosted on Neon, for persistent storage of all application data.
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI's GPT-5 is central to intelligent email analysis, response generation, appointment suggestions, and natural language rule creation for custom alerts, including AI-powered email search.
- **Authentication**: A dual authentication system supports Replit Auth (OpenID Connect) for administrators and direct Replit users, and Email/Password for invited users.
- **Document Storage**: Per-user cloud storage with support for Google Drive and OneDrive. Each user can configure their own OAuth credentials for secure and isolated document storage. The system supports automatic categorization into a hierarchical folder structure. Credentials are encrypted using AES-256-GCM and stored securely per user.
- **UI/UX Decisions**: Consistent display of category icons and colors across the application (Dashboard, Settings, Email Badges). Dynamic displays for task statuses in the dashboard. **Dashboard Charts (2025-10-31 - FULLY RESPONSIVE)**: All 6 dashboard charts (Tasks Evolution, Alerts Evolution, Email Evolution, Email Distribution, Appointments, Category Processing) feature harmonized responsive design with Tailwind CSS-based adaptive heights (200px mobile, 250px desktop), optimized margins (left: -10 for space recovery), consistent 40px Y-axis width, 12px font sizes for readability, tooltip cursor effects, and responsive skeletons. ChartPeriodControls use flex-col sm:flex-row layout to stack vertically on mobile and display horizontally on desktop, preventing Select dropdown overflow from Card boundaries. E2E tested and architect-validated across mobile (375px) and desktop (1920px) viewports. Alert cards feature hover effects and cursor-pointer to indicate clickability. Calendar views support Day, Week, and Month modes with adaptive navigation.
- **System Design Choices**: Global category system with flexible assignment to multiple email accounts via a junction table. Category deletion automatically transfers affected emails to a fallback "autre" category. Email read/unread status is tracked independently of processed status. Tasks associated with an email are automatically completed when the email is marked as "traité". Task assignment to users is supported. Appointment selection dialog for days with multiple appointments. Automated scanning of individual email accounts with configurable frequency and retention.
- **Multi-Tenancy & Security**: The system implements strict company-level data isolation enforced at the database schema level. All core entities (users, email_accounts, categories, settings, tasks, appointments, alerts, alert_rules, emails) include a `companyId` foreign key. **Status (2025-10-31 - FULLY SECURED + REGRESSION TESTED)**: ✅ All cross-tenant vulnerabilities **completely mitigated and validated**. User-facing endpoints fully secured with companyId filtering. All dashboard/stats queries use direct `emails.companyId` filtering (removed fragile LEFT JOINs). Background services (`alertService.ts`, `reminderService.ts`) iterate per company via `getAllCompanies()` and pass companyId to all storage calls with per-tenant try-catch isolation. `getAllEmails()` and `getEmailsCount()` enforce companyId requirement at both type-level AND runtime (throws error if omitted). **Sidebar Counts (getSidebarCounts)**: Fixed critical multi-tenant vulnerability where badge counts aggregated data across ALL companies instead of filtering by companyId - all 6 metrics (unprocessedEmails, unresolvedAlerts, tasksNew, tasksInProgress, upcomingAppointments, documentsInUnprocessedEmails) now enforce company isolation. **Documents Security (2025-10-31 - FULLY SECURED)**: ✅ Closed critical multi-tenant data leak in document access. The `documents` table links to `emails` via `emailId` (emails have `companyId`). All 4 document endpoints now enforce company isolation via INNER JOIN with emails table and companyId verification: `GET /api/documents` (list with mandatory companyId filter), `GET /api/documents/:id/download` (download with company check), `POST /api/documents/:id/ocr` (OCR processing with company check), `GET /api/emails/:id/documents` (email's documents with company check). `getDocuments()` throws error if companyId missing, ensuring no accidental cross-tenant queries. **OIDC Auth (replitAuth.ts)**: Auto-creates companies for new OIDC users; gracefully handles email conflicts by reusing existing trial/subscription users to prevent duplicates. **Regression Testing**: E2E multi-tenant isolation test confirms zero cross-tenant data leakage (created 2 companies, 4 emails, multiple alerts - verified cross_tenant_leak=0 via JOIN queries on alerts→alert_emails→emails). Architect-validated complete tenant isolation across all layers with production-ready status.

Trial users receive immediate access with admin privileges, trial expiration tracking via `trialEndsAt` field, and seamless conversion to paid plans. **Payment Flow (2025-10-31 - FULLY FIXED)**: ✅ Dual-path account provisioning system ensures reliable account creation after successful Stripe payments. Primary path uses `/api/stripe-webhook` for asynchronous processing; fallback path uses `/api/verify-payment` endpoint called automatically by PaymentSuccess page to handle dev environments where webhooks are unavailable. Idempotent design with `getUserByEmail` guard prevents duplicate account creation from simultaneous webhook + fallback invocations. Payment verification includes loading/error/success states with manual retry capability.
